## 1. Project description:
The Iris dataset contains data on four features: length and width of sepals and petals for 50 data samples belonging to three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The aim of this report was to use k-means analysis to classify data samples into clusters based on two out of four features mentioned above.
